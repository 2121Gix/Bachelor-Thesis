\emph{
A dutiful and heartfelt thank you goes out to all the people directly and indirectly involved in this journey and which I was lucky to be flanked to during its entire three years and a half duration. Without each of them it would not have been possible to complete it and enjoy all the satisfaction that it brought.\\
Firstly I want to thank Professor Casari, supervisor, and Doctor Lotito, co-supervisor, for allowing the realization of this work through their availability to follow me, professionality and precision to guide me and for all the knowledge transmitted to me.\\
I also want to thank my colleagues from the Computer Science course for all the good moments shared inside and outside the University and for the mutual help. Special thanks go out to Nicola, fellow student of mine for the past eleven years, with whom it has always been a pleasure to work and on whom I could always count. \\
Heartfelt thank you to my girlfriend Alyssa for being the closest to me despite the distance, for all the support and for always encouraging me to prove myself and keep going. I owe her much of this achievement for always being my biggest source of motivation for a year and a half now.\\
Thanks to my family for encouraging me to continue studying and allowing all this through the economic and moral support, for growing me and for all the teachings that made me become the man I am today.\\
Last but not least, a big thank you to all my friends for being there since day one, for all the good memories shared and for lightening all the stressful and difficult moments I have been through during this journey.}
